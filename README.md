# Cross platform comparison
For my bachelor project in cooperation with Business Academy Aarhus I conducted an analysis of current available mobile cross platform frameworks. I picked the most promising ones (Flutter, React-Native, Cordova Apache) based on popularity within the developer community, adoption and technology behind them. To better understand as well as to create a point of reference for myself i made a small implementation for each. To better understand state management I also implemented the FLUX pattern in the React Native app as well the BLoC pattern in the Flutter app. In the thesis I further analyse and compare them based on articles, documentation and my own experience as well as any other information i found relevant.


You can find the thesis here [mobile-cross-platform-framework-analysis.pdf]
In the thesis I do an in-depth look into the technology behind them, technology stacks surrounding them, performance, development speed, learning curve and general strenghts and weaknesses of each framework. 
 
## Flutter - Getting Started
Make sure you have flutter installed. 
Make sure you have a device connected or an emulator running
```
