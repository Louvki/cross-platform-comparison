# Cross platform comparison

In the thesis I do an in-depth analysis of Flutter, React Native and Cordova Apache and the technology stacks surrounding them
 
 A small flutter todo app that uses the https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ for its data and implements the BLoC pattern. Made for learning purposes.
 
 
## Flutter - Getting Started
Make sure you have flutter installed. 
Make sure you have a device connected or an emulator running
```
cd ./flutter-todo
flutter packages get
flutter run
```


 ## React native - Getting Started
Make sure you have your device connected or an emulator running
```
cd ./flutter-todo
flutter packages get
flutter run
```


 ## Ionic - Getting Started

npm install
npm run start
```
This will start the application localhost port 4200
